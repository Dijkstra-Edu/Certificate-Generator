git clone https://github.com/your-username/Certificate-Generator.git
cd Certificate-Generator
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:

.\venv\Scripts\activate        # On Windows
# OR
source venv/bin/activate       # On macOS/Linux
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is missing or incomplete, install dependencies manually:

```bash

```

Then, start the FastAPI server:

```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

You should see:

```
Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

- **Interactive Docs (Swagger UI):**  
  ðŸ‘‰ `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`  
  Use this to test endpoints for:

  - Fetching GitHub data
  - Custom parameter search
